# Advanced Forcefields
By Slimeist for **1.16**.

## Credit
I wrote this as a pretty beginner modder, so I have borrowed some code from various mods, listed here:
* **Quark** by Vazkii - Pipe models and basic block code
* **Immersive Engineering** by BluSunrize - gui elements under [com.slimeist.aforce.client.gui.ie_elements](src/main/java/com/slimeist/aforce/client/gui/ie_elements) are directly copied,
  and [ContainerScreenForceModifier](src/main/java/com/slimeist/aforce/client/gui/ContainerScreenForceModifier.java) is based off of IE.
* **Reliquary** by P3pp3rF1y - [MobHelper](src/main/java/com/slimeist/aforce/core/util/MobHelper.java) is copied
